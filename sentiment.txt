Web has changed the way people express their opinions about an entity, hence, enabled researchers to collect the opinionated texts from Web and conduct their research. 

Today, Sentiment Analysis has been incorporated by hundreds of companies and has a wide range of use in academia.

 	\textit{
 "The king suite was spacious, clean, and well appointed. The reception staff, bellmen, and housekeeping were very helpful. Requests for extras from the maid were always provided.\ldots The neighborhood is the best for shopping, restaurants."
